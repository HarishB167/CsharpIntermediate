1. Class
is a building block of an application.
UML - general-purpose, developmental, modelling language

- 3 parts of class :
Name of class
Data - represented by fields
Behaviour - represented by function / methods

- We don't declare fields public

- Members
Instance members - only accessible to instances
Static members - only accessible to classes
static is used represent concepts that are singleton

- Declaring static
add static after access modifier.

- Constructor
is a method
called when instance is created
to put an object in an early state.
has same name as class name.
doesn't have return type.
Overloading : same name methods, with different parms taking signature.
Executing other constructor : public Customer(int id) : this() {}

- Object Initializers
Initializing without constructors
var p = new Person { fName = "Aman", lName = "Kumar" }
Only use constructors when some state is essential for class usability.

- Methods
Signature of Methods : Name of method, Type and number of parameters.
Method overloading : same method name, but different signatures.
Params modifier : passing varying no of parameters,
    public void func(params int[] arrayList)
Ref modifier : when we want reference to be passed instead of value, so editing of variable in function will result into modification of passed value outside function.
    public void func(ref int a) {}
    func(ref b);
Out modifier : similar to ref, but requires setting/change of value in the function.

- Fields
Initialization : fields independent on input can be initialized outside constructor in field declaration.
Read-only fields : fields can only be initialized/declared in constructor or field declaration. public readonly List<> list = new List<>();

- Access modifiers
Public, Private, Protected, Internal, Protected Internal
OOP - Enapsulation / Information hiding, Inheritance, Polymorphism
Encapsulation :
Define fields as private
Provide getters/setters methods as public.
private fields should be named with camel case and prefix with _.

- Properties
what - it is a class member, encapsulates getter/setter for field access.
why - to create getter/setter with less code.
how - 
public DateTime Birthdate
{
    get { return _birthdate; }
    set { _birthdate = value; }
} 
Auto-impelemented properties :
public DateTime Birthdate { get; set; }
Making property unsettable - don't declare set method.
Settable only once - make { get; private set; }, and set using constructor.

- Indexers
What - accessing elements in a class that represents list of values. 
How - similar to properties as
public string this[string key]
{
    get { ... logic for getting value from private list }
    set { ... logic for setting value in private list }
}


2. Association Between classes
- Class coupling
Measure of how interconnected classes and subsystem are.
Tightly coupled, loosely coupled
Types of relationships
Inheritance, Composition

- Inheritance
What is inheritance :
Inheriting code from another class.
Is-A relationship (A Car is a Vehicle)
benefits :
code re-use
polymorphic behaviour
UML notation :
Syntax :
public class ChildClass : ParentClass {}
In C# class can have only one parent.

- Composition
What : 
Allows one class to contain another class.
Has-a relationship (Car has an Engine)
Benefits :
Code re-use
Flexibility
loose-coupling
Syntax :
public class Class
{
   private RelatedClass _related;
   public Class(RelatedClass related)
   {
      _related = related;
   }
}

- Favour Composition over Inheritance
Problems with Inheritance :
Easily abused by amateurs
Large hierarchies
Fragility
Tightly coupling
Benefits of Composition :
Great flexibility
Loose coupling
